# SpyFi (PicoCTF 2018)
  
> James Brahm, James Bond's less-franchised cousin, has left his secure communication with HQ running, but we couldn't find a way to steal his agent identification code. Can you?  
> A [file](https://github.com/EnigmaEnvoy/CTF-Practice/blob/main/SpyFi/spy_terminal_no_flag.py) containing the encryption scheme was also given.  
  
  
We use the attack mentioned in this [blog](https://zachgrace.com/posts/attacking-ecb/) to attack the cipher and get the flag appended.  
The complete code along with comments is given in this [file](https://github.com/EnigmaEnvoy/CTF-Practice/blob/main/SpyFi/spy_terminal_solved.py).
