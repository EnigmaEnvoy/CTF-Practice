> Another file - [encrypt.py](https://github.com/EnigmaEnvoy/CTF-Practice/blob/main/LogCaesar/encrypt.py) is also provided along with the [encrypted text](https://github.com/EnigmaEnvoy/CTF-Practice/blob/main/LogCaesar/encrypted.txt).
  
  
As we can see in the given file, the plaintext is 256 bytes long and all the characters are shuffled according to a key. 
We consider all keys from 0 to 255 and reverse the decrypt function as shown in [decrypt.py](https://github.com/EnigmaEnvoy/CTF-Practice/blob/main/LogCaesar/decrypt.py).
